Websites for journalists 
========================

A workshop to create a simple portfolio or story site.

This tutorial will walk you through the process of building a simple 
portfolio website using Google spreadsheets to manage your content and data.
It is meant to familiarize newsroom staff with basic web concepts
and technologies and to produce a useful product.

You will get hands-on experience in every stage of the development process,
writing HTML, CSS, and template logic, recording your work using Git's version
control system. By the end your work will be published online.

This guide was prepared for training sessions at the Chicago Tribune by David Eads.
It was debuted on March 27, 2014. 

Working example to come.

.. note::

    If you have some experience with these technologies or a work-related project to
    work on, use this tutorial as a template for your project.
